- Gained a solid understanding of Generative AI, large language models (LLMs), model pre-training, fine-tuning, and the typical AI project lifecycle.
- Explored fine-tuning methods like instruction tuning and Parameter-efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) to improve model performance and lower computational costs.
- Learned how Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) improves model alignment, and explored chain-of-thought prompting to enhance reasoning abilities.
  Identified challenges such as catastrophic forgetting and knowledge cut-offs, applying solutions like information retrieval techniques and augmentation strategies.
